# Canny-Edge-Detector
This repo contains the python implementation of the computer vision edge detection algorithm, the Canny Edge Detector. The code is wriiten from scratch with no use of open-cv. 
1: first run cell[1] or the very first cell containing library imports to import all the required libraries.

2: Run all the cells bellow cell[2] or the one with the heading Conversion to gray scale. Run all cells bellow this heading by first selecting it and then clicking Cell --> Run All Bellow

3: Select the cells from cell[28] up to cell[149] by selecting one cell and then shift+j to select cells bellow up to cell[149], then click Cell --> Run Cells
OR
Select the second cell containing all images and then with shift+j select bellow cells till the heading Conversion to gray scale (excluded). Run the selected cells by clicking Cell --> Run Cells

4: To see all the results, uncomment the commented cells having just one line of code i.e show_and_save(some element,name)

5: variable  like fx_5 contains the fx value for sigma =0.5 and fx_1 for sigma=1 and fx_2 for sigma=2

Note: Before running the code, change the path of the images
